## 🔹 Step 1: What is Jenkins?

### 🧠 Jenkins is:

> An **open-source CI/CD automation server** used to build, test, and deploy software automatically.

It helps:

* 🚀 Automate your workflows (CI/CD pipelines)
* 🧪 Run tests after every commit
* 📦 Build Docker images and push to registries
* ☁️ Deploy to Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, etc.
* 🔐 Integrate security scanners like Trivy, SonarQube

### 🎯 Jenkins Main Use-Cases

| Task                           | Jenkins Role                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Continuous Integration         | Compile, test, validate              |
| Continuous Delivery/Deployment | Build → Package → Deploy             |
| Infrastructure Automation      | Trigger Terraform, Ansible           |
| Monitoring + Reporting         | Slack/Email alerts on build failures |
| DevSecOps                      | Scan for CVEs, code smells           |

### 🔧 How Jenkins Works (Simplified):

```
    +----------------+           +-------------------+           +------------------+
    |  Developer     |  Pushes   |  GitHub / GitLab  |  Triggers |     Jenkins       |
    | (writes code)  +---------> |   (Repo + Webhook)|--------->| (Executes Pipeline)|
    +----------------+           +-------------------+           +------------------+
                                                                        |
                                                                        V
                                                           +------------------------+
                                                           | Build, Test, Deploy... |
                                                           | Run Docker, Helm etc.  |
                                                           +------------------------+
```

## 🔹 Step 2: Jenkins vs Other Tools

| Feature              | Jenkins             | GitHub Actions   | GitLab CI   | CircleCI  |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Plugin System        | ✅ 1700+ Plugins     | ❌ Limited        | ❌ Moderate  | ❌ Limited |
| UI Customization     | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No             | ❌ No        | ❌ No      |
| Flexibility          | ✅ High              | ✅ Medium         | ✅ Medium    | ✅ Medium  |
| Host Type            | Self-Hosted / Cloud | GitHub only      | GitLab only | Cloud     |
| Real Infra Pipelines | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No real agents | ❌ No        | ❌ No      |

**TL;DR:** Jenkins = **Ultimate Flex + Pain if you don’t set up well**
GitHub Actions = **Convenient + Limited Infra Control**
Jenkins = King of DevOps CI/CD when combined with Kubernetes + Helm + DevSecOps

## 🔹 Step 3: Jenkins Architecture

Let’s break it into 3 pieces:

---

### 🍔 Jenkins Architecture Overview:

1. **Jenkins Controller**

   * Think of it like your **brain** or **main server**
   * It reads your pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`) and **coordinates builds**
   * UI, configurations, plugins — all sit here

2. **Jenkins Agent (Node)**

   * These are **workers** that execute the actual build steps
   * Can be:

     * Docker containers
     * Bare metal VMs
     * Dynamic Pods in Kubernetes
   * Communicate with controller over SSH or WebSockets

3. **Plugins**

   * Plugins = Jenkins superpowers
   * GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, Slack, SonarQube, Trivy, Terraform — all via plugins

---

### 🧠 Example Scenario (Mentally Visualize This):

You commit to GitHub → Jenkins gets webhook → Controller reads Jenkinsfile
→ Triggers an **agent** (in Docker or EC2 or Kubernetes)
→ Agent runs `docker build`, `trivy scan`, `kubectl apply` etc.
→ Controller collects logs and reports back via Slack or UI

---

### 📦 Folder Structure (Typically in real projects):

```
.
├── Jenkinsfile           <- Main pipeline script
├── .jenkins/             <- Custom scripts or libraries
│   └── shared-lib/
├── app/                  <- Your application code
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── ...
└── helm/                 <- Helm chart for K8s
```

## ✅ Recap for Today:

| Concept             | You Learned                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ✅ What Jenkins is   | CI/CD beast for automation          |
| ✅ Why Jenkins?      | Flex, Power, Integration            |
| ✅ Jenkins vs Others | Jenkins = Most Control              |
| ✅ Architecture      | Controller + Agent + Plugins        |
| ✅ Real-world flow   | Git Push → Webhook → Build → Deploy |
